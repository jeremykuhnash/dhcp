A quick guide on what was done to maven enable things:

# Install the xmltypes jar to a local maven repo then use it as a dependency.
# you'd really want Maven to do the gen jar build, maybe as a submodule of the build
# for now we install the one created by a previous compile - wha lah.
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/xmltypes.jar -DgroupId=com.jagornet -DartifactId=xbean -Dversion=2.5 -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=resources/repo

* Use of the build-helper plugin so sources and resources didn't have to be moved. 
* Added an adaptation to allow the SQL schemas to be loaded from the classpath during 'spring boot mode'

Result: 
* Spring Boot Enabled.
* Docker Enabled.
